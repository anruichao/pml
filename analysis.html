here is the steps I took:
identify the dependent variable Y which is classe
delete all the variables contains missing data
use corr() and linear regresion to see which variables are related to classe
subset to train test and cross-validation
use training set to bulit tree and gbm models
predict on cross-validation set to test which one is better
choice gbm model and then predict on testing set
the accuarcy is great, but it is slow. so may need to use PCA to preprocess the data to reduce the variables(x)
